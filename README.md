# Narrative Visualization

This project is a narrative visualization of global temperature changes from 2000 to 2020. It uses D3.js to create an interactive slideshow with three scenes: an overview, a year focus, and an interactive map.

## Scenes
- **Scene 1: Overview** - A line chart showing temperature trends from 2000 to 2020.
- **Scene 2: Year Focus** - Detailed focus on the year 2010 with annotations.
- **Scene 3: Interactive Map** - A map allowing users to explore regional temperature changes over time.

## Usage
- Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to view the visualization.
